Music Player UI:

This is a music player interface I designed myself using 5 HTML, 3 CSS, and 6 JavaScript.

Current Features:

- A neon design in sky blue.

A powerful and beautiful chat mode.

- A powerful search engine.
- I will integrate the interface with a "Phi-2" AI model and a YouTube search engine.

What I'm Looking For:
I need help with:

- Integrating the YouTube search engine.
- Support for song searches.
- Storing all searched songs.
- Improving performance for weak devices.
- Integrating the template within the interface.
- Adding powerful techniques to the template, such as implementing commands in the interface through the template, etc.
- Adding powerful techniques to the engine, such as filtering results and accelerating the engine, etc.

UI Developer:
My name is Emad. I'm 12 years old. I love programming and game development. I currently have ambitions to make my game very powerful.

Would you like to contribute?
Welcome! You can:

- Fork the project.
- Improve it and send a pull request.
- Or contact me via GitHub.

Notes:
The way the engine displays the results retrieved from YouTube is completely different from other interfaces. Here's how it displays them:

- It retrieves 7 results, each of which takes the video cover, video title, and audio.
- It displays the title in place of the word "no song," displays the cover inside a small box, and displays the audio in the background.
- Please add more technologies to the engine and model from your own experience.
- Technologies I'd like the model to include:
- Accelerate sentence generation using Rust.
- Filter what the model will say to the user before displaying it.
- Understanding intent.
- Natural language understanding (NLP).
- Implement commands in the interface through the model, such as playing or pausing music or saving the song to your favorites.
- Chat mode is activated by long-pressing the "OK" button.
- Technologies I want in the engine:
- Results filtering technology: If the user searches for something that isn't a song, a message appears in the bottom right corner of the screen indicating that they're trying to search for something that isn't a song.
- The engine doesn't select ads or live streaming videos.
- Please don't mix things up in the interface design.
- I strongly advise you to try the interface first, interact with it, understand its structure and everything in it, analyze it, and then modify it.

Thank you very much ❤️
